I am inseushu. I love programming, making digital art, animation, interactivity and producing music. My goal is to make interactive art and games on the GUI through utilizing a multidisciplinary skillset.

At this current point in time, I am studying the Advanced Diploma in Games Development specializing in Games Programming at the Academy of Interactive Entertainment learning languages, frameworks and tools such as C#, C++, OpenGL, Unity, Ureal Engine 4 and many more.

Additionally, I am also practicing programming in Lua and using the LÃ–VE framework for games and interactivity.

Wish me luck : )
