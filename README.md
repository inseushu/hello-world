I am inseushu. I love programming, making digital art, animation, interactivity and producing music. Technologies I like to play around with are Node.js and its packages, Javascript, MEAN stack, Lua, Love2d, C# and C++.

At this current point in time, I am studying the Advanced Diploma in Games Development specializing in Games Programming at the Academy of Interactive Entertainment.

Wish me luck : )
